Data is integrated in the form of live data streams. Based on connected\ndata, StreamPipes provides another module called the pipeline editor, which can be used to apply real-time analytics\nalgorithms on connected data stream. To this end, a library of pre-defined algorithms can be used. Out of the box,\nStreamPipes provides more than 100 pipeline elements tailored at manufacturing data analytics. This includes simple\nrule-based algorithms (e.g., flank detection, peak detection, boolean timers), as well as the possibility to integrate\nmore sophisticated ML-based algorithms. Finally, the pipeline editor allows to integrate with third-party systems by\nusing a variety of data sinks (e.g., to forward data to messaging brokers such as Apache Kafka, MQTT or RocketMQ, to\nstore data in databases such as PostgreSQL or Redis or to trigger notifications). Besides pipelines, an included data\nexplorer allows to visually analyze industrial IoT data. For this purpose, a number of visualizations are integrated\nthat allow non-technical users to quickly get first insights.
