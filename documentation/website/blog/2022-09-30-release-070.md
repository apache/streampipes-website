The Apache StreamPipes (incubating) community is delighted to announce the release of Apache StreamPipes version 0.70.0!
Key highlights of this release include many enhancements to the data explorer for fast exploration of IoT data and
a brand new asset management that allows importing and exporting of StreamPipes resources.
In addition, our new version includes more than 50 improvements and bug fixes.

## Preview of Event Schema
A very important and inevitable step when connecting to a data source with Apache StreamPipes 
is the definition of the event schema. By collecting some sample events, Apache StreamPipes is able to suggest 
an event schema that describes the data structure of the incoming events.
Although this works quite well in the vast majority of cases, there is usually a need to modify the proposed
event schema to some degree or add additional fields. So far, a user has gotten little idea of what 
the revised data source event schema looks like until the adapter has been was created and some data was consumed.
With this release, we have included a before/after comparison of the event schema while defining the event schema.
This allows to compare the proposed event schema of Apache StreamPipes (`before`) with the event schema after 
all the user's changes have been by the user have been applied (`after`).
The after view adapts to each interaction of the user.

## Export and Import StreamPipes Resource
With this release we introduce a completely new module called `Asset Management`.
This can be selected in the menu bar of the modules on the left side as the third last icon and 
is marked by a construction icon. This module allows to combine several StreamPipes resources to a so called `Asset`,
which can be exported and re-imported later. To do this, a new asset must first be created.
Afterwards the asset can be edited and the following detail view allows to link all resources 
available in StreamPipes to the asset. After the asset has been finally saved, the asset can be downloaded 
within the configuration module by switching to the `Export/Import` tab. All existing assets are listed there and 
can be selected for download.
The downloaded file can then be re-imported later in the same or another StreamPipes instance at the same place.

## Download Data of Configured Query from Data Lake
Another new feature is the ability to download or export data from the StreamPipes data lake
defined by a user-defined query. Previously, it was only possible to download all events belonging to a data lake index
from the `Data Lake` tab of the configuration menu. In addition to this, each widget in the `Data Explorer`
offers the possibility to download the corresponding data. The underlying query is created from the configuration 
of the widget and is also used to create the widget's figure.
The download supports both `CSV` and `JSON` format.

## Slide View in Data Explorer
Traditionally, the graphs created in the Data Explorer are displayed in a grid view, where the user can adjust
the arrangement of the figures as well as their height and width.
With this release, another option for displaying the dashboard widgets is available: the slide view.
This view allows to display a single graph in full-screen mode and switch between views using a horizontal menu bar.
When a new `Data View` is created in the Data Explorer, a choice can be made between `grid view` and 
`slide view` as the default display mode.
Once a `Data View`is created, the display mode can be changed by clicking the icon in the upper left corner 
right next to the `Back` button.

## Templates for Adapter Configuration
Similar to the processing elements, it is now possible to create templates for adapter configurations.
This allows you to start from a previously defined set of configuration settings when creating similar adapters.
To create a template for an adapter configuration, start by creating a new adapter and
configuring all the settings that will be part of the template. Before proceeding to the field
configuration (the second step of adapter creation), save the current configuration as a template.
Whenever a new instance of the same adapter is created, the template can be selected from
the drop-down menu that appears. Templates are only available for the same type of adapter (obviously).

## Upload Multiple Files at Once
A rather small but very handy improvement is the possibility to upload multiple files at once to StreamPipes.
When you click the `UPLOAD NEW FILE` button in the `File Management` module, it is now possible to select
as many files as you want in the file upload dialog.

## Switch to Mono-Repo Approach
Traditionally, Apache StreamPipes was divided into three major repositories: [incubator-streampipes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes),
[incubator-streampipes-extensions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-extensions),
and [incubator-streampipes-installer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-installer). 
The first essentially contained the Apache StreamPipes backend with all underlying functionality, boilerplate code, 
and Apache StreamPipes modules. The second contained all the elements intended for processing data:
the adapters (data input), the processing elements (data processing and manipulation), and the data sinks (data output).
The third included different installation and operation modes of Apache StreamPipes (CLI, K8S, and Docker Compose).
With the goal of having a single point of contact and, more importantly, simplifying the deployment process,
all repositories were merged into one large repository containing everything that is part of Apache StreamPipes itself.
The only repository where all Apache StreamPipes software is managed is the [incubator-streampipes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes) repository.
The others are still available on GitHub as archived projects, but are no longer maintained.
