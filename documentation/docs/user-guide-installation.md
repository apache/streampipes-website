## Prerequisites

### Hardware

* Docker (latest version, see instructions below)
* Docker Compose (latest version., see instructions below)

### Supported operating systems
We rely on Docker and support three operating systems for the StreamPipes system

* Linux
* OSX
* Windows 10
    * Please note that older Windows versions are not compatible with Docker. Also Linux VMs under Windows might not work, due to network problems with docker.

### Web Browser
StreamPipes is a modern web application, therefore you need a recent version of Chrome (recommended), Firefox or Edge.

### Docker
You need to have Docker installed on your system before you continue with the installation guide.


<div class="admonition info">
<div class="admonition-title">Install Docker</div>
<p>Go to https://docs.docker.com/installation/ and follow the instructions to install Docker for your OS. Make sure docker can be started as a non-root user (described in the installation manual, donâ€™t forget to log out and in again) and check that Docker is installed correctly by executing docker-run hello-world</p>
</div>

<div class="admonition info">
<div class="admonition-title">Configure Docker</div>
<p>By default, Docker uses only a limited number of CPU cores and memory.
       If you run StreamPipes on Windows or on a Mac you need to adjust the default settings.
       To do that, click on the Docker icon in your tab bar and open the preferences.
       Go to the advanced preferences and set the **number of CPUs to 6** (recommended) and the **Memory to 4GB**.
       After changing the settings, Docker needs to be restarted.</p></div>

<div class="admonition error">
<div class="admonition-title">Errors during the installation process</div>
<p>In most cases, errors during the installation are due to an under-powered system.<br/>
If there is a problem with any of the components, please restart the whole system and delete the "config" directory on the server.
   This directory is in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file.<br/>
   Please also make sure that your system meets the hardware requirements as mentioned in the first section of the installation guide.</p>
