## Description
The Throughput Monitoring processor computes throughput statistics.

***

## Required Input
The processor works with any input event.

***

## Configuration

### Batch Window Size
Specifies the number of events that should be used for calculating throughput statistics.


## Output
The processor outputs a new event containing:
* The current timestamp (timestamp)
* The start time of the batch window (starttime)
* The end time of the batch window (endtime)
* The duration between both windows (duration)
* The number of events collected in the window (should be equal to batch size)
* The throughput in events per second
