## Description

Measures the size of an incoming event and appends this number to the event by serializing it.

***

## Required input
The size measure processor does not have any specific input requirements.

***

## Configuration

You can specify if the size should be in Bytes, Kilobytes (1024 Bytes) or in Megabytes (1024 Kilobytes).

## Output
The size measure processor appends the size of the event (without the field, which is getting added) as a double. The rest of the event stays the same.
