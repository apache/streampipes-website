## Description
This limits the number of events emitted based on a specified criterion such as time, and number of events.

***

## Required input
The processor works with any input event.

***

## Configuration

### Enable Grouping
Enabling this will use grouping with rate-limiting (note: disabling this will ignore `Grouping Field` property).

### Grouping Field
Runtime field to be used as the grouping key. If grouping is disabled, this setting will be ignored.

### Window Type
This specifies the type of window to be used (time / length / cron).

### Length Window Size
Length window size in event count (note: only works with length window type).

### Time Window Size
Time window size in milliseconds (note: only works with time window type).

### Cron Window Expression
Cron expression [Link](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html) to trigger and emit events (i.e `0 * * ? * *` for every minute) (note: only works with cron window type).

### Output Event Selection
This specifies the event(s) that are selected to be emitted.
- First: emit first event of the window.
- Last: emit last event of the window.
- All: emit all events of the window.

## Output
The processor outputs events which satisfies rate-limiting conditions.
