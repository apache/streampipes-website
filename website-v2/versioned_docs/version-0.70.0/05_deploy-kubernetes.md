## Prerequisites
Requires Helm (https://helm.sh/) and an active connection to a kubernetes cluster with a running tiller server.

Tested with:
* K3s v1.18.8+k3s1 (6b595318) with K8s v1.18.8
* Helm v3.1.2

## Usage
We provide two helm chart options to get you going:

- **default**: a light-weight option with few pipeline elements, needs less memory
- **full**:  contains more pipeline elements, requires **>16 GB RAM** (recommended)

**Starting** the **default** helm chart option is as easy as simply running the following command from the root of this folder:
> **NOTE**: Starting might take a while since we also initially pull all Docker images from Dockerhub.

```bash
helm install streampipes ./
```
After a while, all containers should successfully started, indicated by the `Running` status.
```bash
kubectl get pods

```

After all containers are successfully started just got to your browser and visit any of the k8s cluster nodes on
`http://<NODE_IP>` to finish the installation.

> **NOTE**: If you're running Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows with a local k8s cluster, the above step to use your host IP might not work. Luckily, you can port-forward a service port to your localhost using the following command to be able to access the UI either via `http://localhost` or `http://<HOST_IP>` (you require sudo to run this command in order to bind to a privileged port).
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ui --address=0.0.0.0 80:80
```

Starting the **full** helm chart option is almost the same:
```bash
helm install streampipes ./ --set deployment=full
```

**Deleting** the current helm chart deployment:
```bash
helm del streampipes
```
