## Description

This processors computes the duration of a task, i.e., a field containing a task description. It outputs an event
 every time this task value changes and computes the duration between the first occurrence of this task and the
  current event. For instance, you can use this event to calculate the time a specific process step requires.
***

## Required input

A timestamp value is required and a field containing a task value.

***

## Configuration

(no further configuration required)

## Output

Emits an event that contains the process step, built from the names of the first task identifier and the identifier
 of the subsequent task. In addition, the duration is part of the output event, provided in milliseconds.
