## Description
The Numerical Text Filter processor filters numerical values based on a given threshold and text values 
based on a given string. It only forwards events in case both criteria are satisfied.

***

## Required input
The processor works with any input event that has one field containing a numerical value and one field 
containing a text.

***

## Configuration

### Number Field
Specifies the field name where the filter operation should be applied on.

### Number Operation
Specifies the filter operation that should be applied on the field.

### Number Threshold
Specifies the threshold value.

### Text Field
The field containing the text that should be filtered.

### Text Operation
The operation used by the filter processor (equals or matches).

### Text Keyword
Specifies the keyword to filter the text field.

## Output
The processor outputs the input event if it satisfies the filter expression.
