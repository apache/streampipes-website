## Description

Detects sentences in a text and splits the text accordingly. Only works with english sentences.

***

## Required input

A stream with a string property which contains a text.

***

## Configuration

Simply assign the correct output of the previous stream to the tokenizer input.
To use this component you have to download or train an openNLP model:
https://opennlp.apache.org/models.html

## Output

Creates for each sentence in a text a new event in which it replaces the text with the sentence.

**Example:**

Input: `(text: "Hi, how are you? I am fine!")`

Output: `(text: "Hi, how are you?")`, `(text: "I am fine!")`
