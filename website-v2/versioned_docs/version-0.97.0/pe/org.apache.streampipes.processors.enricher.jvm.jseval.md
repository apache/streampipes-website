## Description
A pipeline element that allows writing user defined JavaScript function to enrich events.

***

## Required input
This processor does not have any specific input requirements.

## Configuration
User can specify their custom enrichment logic within the `process` method. Please note that the `process` function 
must be in the following format and it must return a map of data which is compatible with the output schema.
```javascript
    function process(event) {
        // do processing here.
        // return a map with fields that matched defined output schema.
        return {id: event.id, tempInCelsius: (event.tempInKelvin - 273.15)};
    }
```

## Output
A new event with the user defined output schema.
