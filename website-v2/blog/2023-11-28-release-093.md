We're excited to share the release of StreamPipes 0.93.0, bringing with it a range of bug fixes, performance
enhancements, and new features. This release places a strong emphasis on refining the technical foundations of
StreamPipes, featuring significant changes that set the stage for our upcoming 1.0 release.
Nevertheless, we have also worked on several improvements that are directly visible to the end user.
Nevertheless, we haven't overlooked the end-user experience and have implemented several enhancements.
Let's delve into the key updates introduced in this release.

## Adapters & Pipeline Elements

### OPC-UA allows detailed & asynchronous browsing

We have fully reworked the browsing interface of our OPC-UA adapter.

Now, all you need to do is specify the URL where the OPC UA server is accessible, eliminating the need to concern
yourself with namespaces or node ids. Once the URL is provided, the adapter effortlessly presents all top-level nodes
within the user interface. You can then navigate through the node tree interactively by clicking on the desired node.

For every data node, accessing node information is a breeze â€“ simply click on the eye icon. If you wish to subscribe to
a particular node, a straightforward click on the plus icon is all it takes.

All the nodes you select become integral to the event structure of this adapter, accessible by clicking on 'Next'. The
ensuing view not only displays the OPC UA status for each node but also allows for the removal of a node with ease,
especially if its status is not 'Good'.

### Adapter for S7 PLCs supports array-based data

Until now, our S7 PLC adapter lacked the capability to read values structured in arrays. We're pleased to announce that
this limitation has been addressed through the introduction of an 'Advanced' register input mode.

<img src="/img/blog/2023-11-28/s7-advanced-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of new advanced register input mode for S7 PLC adapter"/>

This new mode empowers you to configure the registers to be queried in a manner specific to the requirements of our
underlying dependency, [PLC4X](https://plc4x.apache.org). For detailed insights and guidance on the configuration
process, refer to the [PLC4X S7 documentation](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/s7.html).

When dealing with array definitions, the configuration would resemble the following:

```text
# propertyName=%{Memory-Area}{start-address}:{Data-Type}[{array-size}]
temperature=%DB3.DB0.0[BOOL]
```

### New Adapter: ifm IOLink

The [IO-Link Master (AL1350)](https://www.ifm.com/de/en/product/AL1350) from ifm comes equipped with an IoT interface
designed for transmitting sensor data via MQTT. With the introduction of this adapter, users gain the capability to
effortlessly incorporate IO-Link sensor data into StreamPipes.

By leveraging this adapter, users can achieve seamless integration, creating a unified and consistent event schema
within StreamPipes. This integration empowers users to effortlessly connect to data from any ifm sensor linked to the
IO-Link Master using StreamPipes.

For more details refer to
the [adapter documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/next/pe/org.apache.streampipes.connect.iiot.adapters.iolink/).

### New Processor: Numeric Rounding

Introducing our latest data processor, `Numeric Rounding`, designed to perform rounding operations on numeric values
within an event stream. This processor enables users to select one or more numeric values from their event data,
specifying the desired rounding precision and the rounding mode.

For more details refer to
the [processor documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/next/pe/org.apache.streampipes.processors.transformation.jvm.round/).

### UX improvements

#### Ordered measurement units

In the adapter configuration step, when setting up a transformation rule for an event value, the available units of
measurement are now conveniently organized in alphabetical order for improved accessibility and ease of selection.

#### Extended information for existing adapters

When accessing the *Connect* module, a comprehensive list of all existing adapters is presented. Within this view, each
adapter now includes details about the timestamp of the last event creation and the total count of elements published
since startup. This enhancement provides a quick and efficient means to evaluate the health of each adapter.

## Deployment

### Kubernetes Deployment

#### Add probes to the Helm chart

Integrating readiness, liveness, and startup probes into StreamPipes' Kubernetes containers enhances the system's health
monitoring. These probes automatically detect and handle anomalies, significantly improving application availability and
stability. The readiness probe ensures preparedness, the liveness probe validates ongoing functionality, and the startup
probe assesses initialization status, collectively fortifying StreamPipes against potential disruptions.

#### Rework the values file

We've refined and simplified the values file for our Helm chart, optimizing its structure. Furthermore, we've invested
in comprehensive documentation for all available options. Check out
the [README file](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/installer/k8s/README.md) of our Helm chart for detailed
information on configuration and deployment.

#### Add Apache Pulsar to Helm file

In our last release, we've expanded StreamPipes' capabilities to include Apache Pulsar as a supported messaging layer.
Alongside this enhancement, our Helm chart has now been updated to seamlessly deploy StreamPipes on Kubernetes with
Pulsar
as the underlying messaging infrastructure.

#### Monitoring Integration (Grafana & Prometheus)

We've now integrated monitoring support for StreamPipes through Prometheus and Grafana, making it seamlessly available
in both our Kubernetes and Docker deployments. If you're using Kubernetes, we recommend checking out
our [Helm chart](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/installer/k8s#monitoring-common-parameters) for
straightforward setup instructions. For Docker users, stay tuned for an upcoming blog post where we'll provide a
step-by-step guide on configuring Prometheus and Grafana to monitor StreamPipes effectively.

### New Deployment mode for first time users

ChatGPT
To simplify onboarding with Apache StreamPipes and demonstrate its capabilities, we've added a quickstart deployment
option. This docker-compose variant provides users with a pre-configured StreamPipes instance and rich examples. Explore
it in our [user guide]("https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/user-guide-for-quickstart/").

## StreamPipes Python

Our official Python support for Apache StreamPipes got some small improvements as well.
Notable among other improvements are especially the following two:

- Support for Python 3.11
- StreamPipes Python does now also support other protocols than Apache Kafka to interact with live data

## Administration & Development

### Email Templates are configurable

StreamPipes already supported the sending of notifications, such as those for password recovery and account
registration, when properly configured. However, in previous versions, the email content was predefined and couldn't be
adjusted. In this latest release, administrators now have the flexibility to modify the email templates, offering
greater customization options for notifications.

## Remove legacy resources

In this release, we've eliminated legacy resources that were initially employed for demonstration purposes. As these
resources are no longer actively supported, we have decided to completely remove them. The affected components include
the vehicle simulator and watertank simulator.

This removal has led to the discontinuation of the StreamPipes package `streampipes-sources`.

## Enable migrations for pipeline elements

We have established a crucial technical foundation to simplify the update process for upcoming versions of StreamPipes.
It is now possible to define migrations for adapters, data processors, and data sinks. For a more in-depth understanding
of how migrations function and how to define them, please refer to
our [documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/extend-sdk-migration/).

## New Homepage

We've undergone a comprehensive redesign of our website, [streampipes.apache.org](https://streampipes.apache.org). Take a moment to explore the new look,
and we welcome your feedback on your experience. Let us know what you think!

## Final Remarks

We highly recommend updating to StreamPipes 0.93.0 to take advantage of these new features, bug fixes, and improvements.
