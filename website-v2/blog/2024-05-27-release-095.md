Within StreamPipes 0.93.0 we introduced the possibility to [edit existing adapters](https://streampipes.apache.org/blog/2023/11/28/release-093/#editing-existing-adapters).
This release improves adapter management even more by conveniently allowing to delete existing adapters even if they are used in a pipeline.
