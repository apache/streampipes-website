## Improved Python Support:
In response to valuable user feedback, we have improved Python support in StreamPipes.
Users can now seamlessly integrate Python-based scripts, libraries, and modules into their functions. 
This enhancement enables leveraging the power of machine learning and advanced analytics algorithms for IIoT data sources. 
Please refer to the [Python documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/python/latest/) for further details.


## New Processing Elements: Introducing the Swinging Door Trending (SDT) Filter Processor:
To expand the functionality of StreamPipes, we have introduced several new processing elements.
Among them is the **Swinging Door Trending (SDT) Filter Processor**.
This processor provides a linear trend compression algorithm. 
Essentially, it replaces a series of continuous points (timestamp, value) with a straight line determined by the start and end points.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements:
We have addressed various bugs and issues reported by our users, resulting in a more stable and reliable StreamPipes experience.
We have also made several performance and usability improvements to enhance overall system efficiency.

## Deprecation of Set Adapters

In order to streamline the StreamPipes ecosystem, we have deprecated the functionality of Set Adapters. 
Going forward, our focus will solely be on streaming event sources. 
However, we understand the importance of working with files of sensor data, especially during development. 
To accommodate this need, we have extended the **File Stream Adapter**, which now offers the following functionalities:
1. Create a live simulation of sensor data based on the file.
2. Replay the data in the file once, for example, to store it in the **Data Lake**.

**IMPORTANT: The set adapters will be removed in the next release.**

From this release onwards, we encourage you to utilize the **File Stream Adapter** instead of the **File Set Adapter**.
To simulate a file set using the **File Stream Adapter**, you can configure it with `Replay Once: Yes` and `Replay Speed: Fastest (Ignore original time)`.
See the example below:

## Final Remarks
We highly recommend updating to StreamPipes 0.92.0 to take advantage of these new features, bug fixes, and improvements. 
For more detailed information, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes/blob/release/0.92.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md#0920).

We appreciate your continued support and valuable feedback. 
StreamPipes is continually evolving, and we are dedicated to providing you with a powerful and reliable platform for your IIoT streaming data needs.
