Great news: StreamPipes is moving to the Apache Incubator!

<!--truncate-->

## The StreamPipes journey so far

We started to build the early foundations of StreamPipes back in 2014 as part of the EU research project _ProaSense_.
Our goal was to make event processing accessible to end users with a focus on the Industrial IoT, without the technical
expertise required by stream processing tooling.
After some very early prototypes (see an early screenshot below :-)) demonstrating the usefulness of the pipeline editor
and the underlying semantics-based data model in two manufacturing-related use cases, we open-sourced StreamPipes in
2017 and continued development in various research projects.
Since then, we presented and showcased StreamPipes at various events: fairs, meetups, conference talks and so on. For
instance, in 2019 we attended over 20 events where we gave demos or talked about StreamPipes.
It is great to see that the solution is now steadily getting increased traction in the Industrial IoT space.

## Moving to the Apache Incubator

Earlier this year, we discussed how to continue the development of StreamPipes. For the core team at FZI, our main goal
was to widen the developer base, attract external developers and to make StreamPipes a real community-driven open source
project.
We had a look at various open source foundations (namely Apache, CNCF and Eclipse), but from the beginning, there was no
doubt that we wanted to see StreamPipes in the Apache Software Foundation. Using a lot of Apache Big Data projects under
the hood ([Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org) and others), an emerging
Apache IoT ecosystem, and the community-driven, open development process of ASF projects, this was an easy decision.
Finally, a few weeks before we went to ApacheCon North America in Las Vegas in September this year to talk about
StreamPipes, we discovered the awesome [Apache PLC4X](https://plc4x.apache.org) project, which perfectly aligns with
StreamPipes tackling the hard task to connect proprietary industrial protocols with modern software tooling.
We met Chris Dutz together with other people from PLC4X and other Apache projects in Las Vegas and were overwhelmed by
the _Apache Way_ and the great collaboration between the various projects within the ASF.

So after coming back home, we immediately started to write the proposal to enter the Apache Incubator, which got
accepted on 2019-11-11.

## New project setup

With the great help from our mentors, we already performed some initial steps required to move our infrastructure over
to the ASF, which will continue during the next week:

* The new website will be soon available under [https://streampipes.apache.org](https://streampipes.apache.org)
* We will move our code repositories over to the ASF on Github. Before that, we'll merge some repos to make future
  releases easier: The **backend and user interface** will be merged to the
  repository [https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes]([https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes).
  Pipeline elements and StreamPipes Connect adapters will also be merged to a new repo called **streampipes-extensions
  **, soon available
  at [https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-extensions](https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-extensions).
  Both **website and documentation** will be available
  at [https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-website](https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-website).
  Finally, the project **streampipes-installer**
  at [https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-installer](https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-installer)
  will contain the installer for Windows and OSX/Linux, the developer-oriented CLI tool and helm charts to install
  StreamPipes in Kubernetes.
* Apache project communication mainly relies on mailing lists. Subscribe to
  the [user list](mailto:users-subscribe@streampipes.apache.org)
  and [dev list](mailto:dev-subscribe@streampipes.apache.org) and help us to improve StreamPipes!
* Issues can be created in the new [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STREAMPIPES).
* All previous releases will be marked as non-ASF-releases to clearly indicate that previous releases do not follow the
  Apache release policy. Yesterday, we released the final pre-Apache
  version [0.65.0](/blog/2019/11/23/release-0650), the next release will be our first Apache release.

## Thanks

We would like to thank Chris Dutz for his great support in doing the first steps in the Apache Incubator.

We would also like to thank our employee, [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](https://www.fzi.de/en), for
the continued great support - starting from giving us the opportunity to present StreamPipes at large fairs such as
Hannover Messe, over media support such as creating the great StreamPipes logo, up to the fast legal support we received
when we got accepted by the Apache Incubator.
If you want to build cool stuff in a great applied research institute while pursuing a PhD at KIT, FZI is surely the
best place to be ;-)

Let's continue development and transform Apache StreamPipes (incubating) into the next Apache community!
