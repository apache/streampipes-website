# Apache StreamPipes 0.98.0 Release

Apache StreamPipes 0.98.0 is a major step forward in the evolution of the platform, delivering **powerful dashboard
enhancements, extended OPC UA capabilities, improved security and authentication**, and a large set of **UX and
architectural refinements**.

This release focuses on consolidating visualization and dashboard functionality, improving operational transparency, and
modernizing the underlying architecture. Highlights include **dashboard cloning and kiosk mode**, **new aggregation
functions**, **enhanced OPC UA authentication and certificate handling**, **file logging support**, and a **modernized
UI**.

In total, this release closes around 100 issues across enhancements, bug fixes, and maintenance tasks.

## Industrial Connectivity & OPC-UA

### Redesign of the adapter creation page

StreamPipes Connect is the central interface to connect a wide variety of industrial protocols with Apache StreamPipes.
In this release, a new overview page simplifies selection of appropriate adapters, taking less space and allowing users
to get a better overview over available connectors.

### OPC UA X.509 Authentication & Certificate Management

Support for OPC-UA security is greatly enhanced in 0.98.0.
We added a new authentication option that supports **X.509 user authentication**. Users can now directly upload their
X.509 certificates which are securely stored within StreamPipes.

For encrypted communication, we also added enterprise features to handle OPC-UA certificates.
Until now, certificates had to be managed through environment variables. In the new release, server certificates can be
**centrally managed** from the user interface, simplifying secure deployments.
In case a non-trusted certificate is provided by the OPC-UA server, the certificate is stored in the StreamPipes core
for manual approval. In the settings menu, admins can explicitly trust or reject a given certificate.
The UI view also contains extended certificate information, making it easy to get an overview of all OPC-UA certificates
that are currently used.

Version 0.98.0 also supports more OPC-UA data types such as better support of **ExtensionObjects**, allowing more
complex OPC-UA data structures to be processed.

These improvements strengthen StreamPipes as a secure and enterprise-ready IIoT integration platform.

### Other improvements

Minor improvements for other adapters include:

- Configurable **wait and lease times** for PLC connectors.
- Improved adapter state handling and recovery options.
- Better schema guessing and duplicate field handling in OPC-UA adapters.

## Dashboards & Data Explorer

### Harmonized Data Explorer & Dashboard Experience

The consolidation of visualization tools is finished in 0.98.0.
The **Chart and Dashboard** views have been further harmonized, ensuring consistent configuration and behavior.
The deprecated dashboard has been removed and the new dashboard tool is fully in place. Users can now add any chart
directly to the live dashboard.

This work lays the foundation for faster innovation and a more consistent visualization experience going forward.

### Dashboard Cloning & Kiosk Mode

Dashboards have received further several long-awaited improvements:

- **Dashboard cloning** allows users to quickly duplicate existing dashboards and reuse configurations.
- **Kiosk mode** enables distraction-free, full-screen dashboards—ideal for shop floor displays and control rooms.
- Improved configuration panel now clearly indicate missing or incomplete dashboard and chart configurations.

These enhancements significantly simplify dashboard reuse and deployment in operational environments.

### New Visualizations & Chart Improvements

Several new visualization and charting capabilities were added:
The **status heatmap visualization** was enhanced with a dedicated color-mapping component, in the **chart appearance
settings**, additional chart-specific configurations were added, including improved heatmap configuration with
customizable min/max values.
To improve usability, icons and descriptions were added to the chart type dropdown, making chart selection more
intuitive.

### New Aggregation Functions

The chart view now supports additional aggregation functions:

- **MEDIAN**
- **SPREAD**
- **STDDEV**

These functions enable more advanced statistical analysis directly within pipelines and the Chart view.

### Excel export

Besides CSV and JSON, datasets can now be directly exported to a Microsoft Excel format (xlsx). In addition, Excel
templates can be uploaded that can be used to add any company-specific header data to an Excel export.

## Security & Authentication

Since we aim for enterprise-grade security, we added additional advanced configuration options to integrate Apache
StreamPipes with 3rd-party authentication providers.

### OAuth & External Authentication Improvements

Security and identity management received several upgrades.

**External role assignment** is now supported in the OAuth configurations. Besides default roles, users can now be
assigned their roles directly from an external authentication service.
To further increase flexibility, StreamPipes-internal roles and groups can be assigned an **alternate ID**, which can be
used to map external role names to StreamPipes roles and groups.

**OAuth and OpenID configurations** are now loaded at startup time, so that invalid settings are detected earlier upon
startup.

### User Management Enhancements

User transparency was improved with:

- Tracking and displaying **user creation date** and **last login date** in the user configuration.
- Optional **terms acknowledgment**, allowing organizations to enforce acceptance of usage terms.

## UX & UI Improvements

### Modernized UI with Material 3

The StreamPipes UI has been upgraded to **Material Design 3**, delivering a cleaner, more modern look and feel.
Additional UI improvements include:

- Broader use of design tokens so that theming becomes easier for external developers.
- Panel resize components for flexible layouts.
- Improved breadcrumb navigation in dashboards.

### StreamPipes becomes multilingual

Release 0.98.0 starts to add internationalization features to Apache StreamPipes.
While this will be a greater effort spanning multiple releases, this new release lays the groundwork for a completely
localized Apache StreamPipes experience.

As a first feature, we've localized most parts of the UI to the german language. More languages will follow in the
future - if you are willing to help us translate StreamPipes to more languages, let us know!

### Actions menu

To ensure a consistent design and a clean, streamlined look and feel, all data tables across StreamPipes now use a
unified actions menu. Instead of displaying multiple action buttons inline, available actions are grouped under a
three-dot menu. Simply hover over the icon to reveal the actions for a given resource, making tables easier to scan
while keeping all functionality readily accessible.

## Developer experience

### Migration to the New Data Processor API

The migration to the **new Data Processor API** continues, improving consistency and performance across pipeline
elements.
As part of this effort:

- The legacy `StreamPipesDataProcessor` and `StreamPipesDataSink` APIs are now **deprecated**.
- The Flink-based wrapper has also been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Developers are encouraged to migrate to the new APIs to ensure long-term compatibility.

### Custom theming

With the upgrade of the design system, we changed the way how the StreamPipes UI can be customized with company-specific
color settings.
Settings that can be used for custom theming have been isolated in two files (```_custom-variables.scss``` and ```_theme-colors.scss```).
We encourage developers to investigate the modified prebuild script and the two scss files to generate individual
theming files.

## Breaking Change

### Default Messaging System Switched to NATS 💣

The default `docker-compose` setup in the **installer directory** now uses **NATS** instead of Apache Kafka for internal
messaging.

⚠️ **Important:**  
This change only affects users who are updating from a previous installation.  
If your existing StreamPipes instance uses Kafka, continue using the provided `docker-compose.kafka.yml` file.

## Deprecations ⚠️

The following components and features are deprecated and scheduled for removal in future versions:

- Deprecated domain property APIs (use semantic type API)
- Nested rule creation functionality
- Legacy configurable data format APIs
- Flink wrapper
- IO-Link IFM adapter
- NetIO adapter

Users are encouraged to migrate early to avoid disruption in upcoming releases.

## Other improvements

As usual, StreamPipes 0.98.0 includes a variety of minor improvements, bug fixes and dependency updates. Users are
encouraged to update as soon as possible.

## Conclusion

Apache StreamPipes 0.98.0 delivers major improvements in **dashboarding, OPC UA integration, security, and user
experience**, while continuing the architectural cleanup and modernization started in previous releases.
