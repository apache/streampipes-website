The Apache StreamPipes (incubating) community is pleased to announce Apache StreamPipes version 0.69.0!
The most notable highlights of this release include a completely reworked data explorer for quick exploration of IoT data and advanced user and access rights management.
In addition, our new release includes more than 80 improvements and bug fixes.

## Data Explorer

Apache StreamPipes 0.69.0 includes a heavily improved data explorer. The new user interface allows to visually explore data streams within minutes.
Any pipeline which uses the ``Data Lake`` sink can be visualized in the data explorer. The completely new query interface allows to easily select date and time ranges and users can choose from either displaying raw data or aggregated time series.
The widget library includes charts to visualize time-series data (e.g., line chart, scatter plots or heatmaps), value distributions (e.g., density or histograms) or single values.
The widget interface is completely customized and users can build rich dashboards.

## User and access rights management
StreamPipes now supports multiple users and roles. The new ``User management`` section in the settings page allows to create individual users and groups.
Various roles can be assigned to users and groups to manage permissions and visible views. For instance, you can now create users which only see dashboards, but cannot create pipelines or connect new data streams.
In addition, individual permissions can be assigned to various resource objects such as pipelines, data streams and dashboards. 

Communication between extensions services and the core are now authenticated by default. Service accounts can be created to allow extensions services to access StreamPipes resources.

## Improved pipeline element modeling
We've removed one of the major drawbacks of previous StreamPipes versions: Pipelines can now be flexibly reconfigured. In previous versions, due to the validation of pipelines and their configuration, only root elements could be modified. 
The new version now gives users full flexibility when modeling pipelines (e.g., by removing or modifying elements from the middle of a pipeline), while pipelines are still continuously validated and modeling errors are shown.
Updating pipelines should now be much less distracting and faster.

## Other new features

### Mail configuration

StreamPipes now includes a configuration interface for mail server settings. These settings are used by the email data sink used to trigger email notifications.
In addition, several system-wide mail services exist, e.g., to restore forgotten passwords.

### Login configuration

The login mechanism can now be configured directly in the user interface. A self-registration can be activated to allow users to create new accounts.
In addition, passwords can be restored by using a two-stage email confirmation process. The profile view allows users to change their passwords individually.

### Redesign of pipeline editor
The pipeline editor has a new look: The pipeline element selection bar has been moved from the top to the left side. The icons are smaller and for each pipeline element, the name and description are shown by default.
This makes it easier to find the elements you're looking for.

### Improved service discovery
Under the hood, we've improved the discovery of extensions services. This is part of a larger effort which will be further improved in the next versions.
Extensions services now automatically register within the core depending on the IP address of the service. Pipeline element descriptions are now free of the hostname and can be easily updated.
Several environment variables exist to manually assign the hostname to an extensions service.

### Performance
We've improved the overall system performance by replacing the triple store with a standard NoSQL database. This leads to huge performance improvements in terms of system start time, pipeline element installation and overall loading time.

### Dark mode ;-)
We know that you wanted this: An experimental dark mode has been added to StreamPipes. The color scheme can be flexibly changed in the profile view and is stored for each user.
The dark mode should be considered experimental, so please expect some layout flaws.

## Migration
While we are not yet ready for automatic migration, a migration guide explains several new concepts introduced in this StreamPipes version.
We aim at providing a backwards compatible version with release 1.0, planned for later this year.
