## Introduction
Apache StreamPipes 0.97.0 brings exciting new features, enhanced security, and significant UX improvements to streamline your IIoT data processing workflows. 
This release introduces **Adapters & Pipelines as Code**, enabling users to define and deploy StreamPipes resources programmatically using YAML or JSON. 
Security enhancements, such as **OPC UA certificate support** and **Kafka SSL/SASL authentication**, improve connectivity and data integrity. 
Additionally, we have made various **UX improvements**, including an **enhanced Data Explorer** and **asset-based filtering**.

In total, the new release closes 159 issues including new features, bug fixes and improvements.

Read on to discover what’s new in StreamPipes 0.97.0!

## Adapters & Pipeline Elements
### Adapter & Pipeline as Code
StreamPipes now supports managing adapters and pipelines programmatically using compact Json or YAML definitions.
These features are ideal for automating deployments, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and applying infrastructure-as-code practices.

#### Adapters as Code

With Adapters as Code, you can define and deploy adapters via a compact description, streamlining the creation of multiple similar adapters and simplifying automation.
For example, here's a sample YAML snippet to define an OPC-UA adapter:

```yml
name: My OPC Adapter
id: testadapter
description: Test
appId: org.apache.streampipes.connect.iiot.adapters.opcua
configuration:
  - opc_host_or_url: OPC_URL
    opc_server_url: opc.tcp://localhost:62541/milo
  - adapter_type: PULL_MODE
    pulling_interval: 1000
  - access_mode: UNAUTHENTICATED
  - available_nodes:
    - "ns=2;s=Leakage Test Station/temperature"
    - "ns=2;s=Leakage Test Station/pressure"

schema:
  temperature:
    propertyScope: measurement
    label: Temp
    description: Temperature value
    semanticType: http://schema.org/temperature

enrich:
  timestamp: timestamp

transform:
  rename:
    pressure: pressure3

createOptions:
  persist: true
  start: true
```

This approach considerably simplifies the programmatic creation of adapters [Learn more about Adapters as Code](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/use-programmatically-create-adapters/)

#### Pipelines as Code

Pipelines as Code lets you define end-to-end data flows—from data sources through processors to sinks.
This function is ideal for the standardization and automation of pipeline deployments.
For example, here’s a sample YAML snippet for a simple pipeline:

```yaml
id: my-pipeline
name: ""
description: ""
pipelineElements:  # Define pipeline components here
  - type: stream     # Data source
    ref: <reference> # Unique reference ID
    id: <data-stream-id> # ID of the stream

  - type: processor  # Data transformation
    ref: <reference> # Unique reference ID
    id: <processor-id> # ID of the processor
    connectedTo:     # Previous pipeline element reference(s)
      - <reference>
    configuration:   # Processor-specific configurations
      - <configuration-option>

  - type: sink       # Data sink (output)
    ref: <reference> # Unique reference ID
    id: <sink-id>    # ID of the sink
    connectedTo:     # Previous pipeline element reference(s)
      - <reference>
    configuration:   # Sink-specific configurations
      - <configuration-option>

createOptions:
  start: <true|false>  # Whether to start the pipeline immediately
```

The code preview of a pipeline has also been added to the `Start Pipeline` dialog, which has been further improved to make the execution status of pipelines more clear.

This method provides a programmatic interface to deploy and manage pipelines quickly and easily.

### OPC UA Certificates
The OPC UA adapter now supports both signed/encrypted and unencrypted communication.
Certificate provisioning is handled externally via environment variables, following a dedicated security directory layout. Refer to the [OPC UA adapter documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/pe/org.apache.streampipes.connect.iiot.adapters.opcua/) for further details.

### Kafka Avro & Certificates
The Kafka adapter and sink now support SSL and SASL for enhanced security.
Additionally, users can provide custom producer/consumer configurations.
A new Avro parser has been added along with an input field for specifying the consumer group in the Kafka adapter.

## New Features & Deprecations 

### Asset Browser
StreamPipes now allows users to model real-world assets and associate them with StreamPipes resources such as adapters, pipelines, and dashboards.
These asset mappings enable intuitive filtering across different modules, making it easier to navigate and manage related resources.

The screenshot below illustrates an example where a StreamPipes instance is configured with two machines and various stations.
Clicking on a machine or station dynamically filters the associated resources in the list on the right.
This asset-based filtering is available across all main modules of StreamPipes.

<img src="/img/blog/2025-02-15/asset_filter.png" alt="Asset Filtering in StreamPipes"/>

The asset overview panel has been redesigned to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. It is possible to assign labels, locations, and ISA95 types to assets.
For each asset, resources such as pipelines, adapters and dashboards can be assigned. The asset overview contains an intuitive overview of all linked resources.

<img src="/img/blog/2025-02-15/asset_view.png" alt="Asset View"/>

To manage locations & sites, we extended the configuration menu with additional options to add a custom map layer provider and to configure the map view.

## UX improvements
### File Relocation
The file upload configuration has been moved from the top-level navigation to the settings menu, improving the overall structure and clarity of the main navigation.

This change does not affect file uploads required by adapters or pipeline elements—these configurations remain unchanged.
Further, users can still upload files as before via the files configuration section.

<img src="/img/blog/2025-02-15/file_upload.png" alt="File upload configuration"/>

### Adapter Data Preview
Viewing live data streams in the adapter configuration has been improved. By clicking on "details", a full-screen view of the data preview is displayed.
Changing data values are highlighted, so that it is ease to track changes. The Code panel shows the configuration in JSON or YAML format.

### Data Explorer Configuration Improvements
Configuring data views in the **Data Explorer** is now more intuitive and user-friendly.
We have enhanced validation, making it easier to select data sources and specify queries while reducing potential misconfigurations.

Key improvements include:
- **Default Table Visualization**: New data views now default to a table view, minimizing setup effort.
- **Improved Time Range Picker**: More flexibility in selecting time ranges, including support for different time ranges per widget in Data Lake dashboards.
- **Auto-Refresh for Dashboards**: Live updates are now possible with the new auto-refresh functionality.
- **Better Error Messages**: Enhanced feedback when configurations are incorrect to improve usability.
- **Custom color coding for pie chart**: In the pie chart, custom colors can be mapped to specific data values.
- **Traffic light visualization**: A new traffic light visualization has been added to the Data Explorer.

Here is a screenshot of the new traffic light visualization:

### Pipeline Details

The pipeline details view has been completely remodeled. It now shows the pipeline in full-screen mode, making it easier to view and edit complex pipelines.
A sidebar contains further information on the pipeline, such as logs, pipeline elements, and execution status.
In addition, execution metrics are now intuitively accessible right in the pipeline details view.

<img src="/img/blog/2025-02-15/pipeline_preview.png" alt="Pipeline preview"/>

### Deprecation Notice: Dashboard
The current live dashboard feature in StreamPipes is being deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
As a replacement, the Data Explorer dashboards has been enhanced with auto-refresh functionality, ensuring a seamless transition for users who rely on real-time data visualization.

The harmonization of data explorer and live dashboard functionalities will provide a more consistent user experience and will ease the addition of new charts in future version, since all visualizations now rely on a single visualization library.

We encourage all users to migrate their existing dashboards to the Data Explorer to continue leveraging powerful visualization and analysis capabilities.

If you think any feature is missing in the data explorer, please let us know!
